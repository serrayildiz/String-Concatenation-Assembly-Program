# String Concatenation Assembly Program

This assembly language program demonstrates string concatenation functionality. It concatenates multiple strings and prints the result.

## Overview

This program is written in MIPS assembly language. It concatenates three strings (`string1`, `string2`, and `string3`) and then prints the concatenated string.

### Functionality

1. **String Concatenation**: It concatenates `string1` and `string2` into a new string.
2. **Print Concatenated String**: It prints the concatenated string to the console.

## How to Use

To run this program, you need a MIPS emulator or simulator. You can use tools like SPIM (MIPS Simulator) or MARS (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator).

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/serrayildiz/string-concatenation-assembly.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd string-concatenation-assembly
   ```

3. **Run the Program**:
   - Use the MIPS emulator or simulator to load and execute the program.
   - Follow the instructions provided by the emulator or simulator to load the assembly code and run it.

## Files Included

- `concatenation.asm`: The main assembly code file containing the string concatenation logic.
- `README.md`: This file, providing information about the project.
- (Optionally) Additional files for supporting scripts, tests, or documentation.
